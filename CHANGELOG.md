# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI Workflow Platform are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-05

Generalization release. The evaluation of v2.x found the architecture strong but
delivery narrow — deep only for auth-shaped features. v3.0 takes `/workflow-builder`
from auth-only depth to broad coverage while keeping the deterministic, traceable
core. All changes are additive; the login-registration golden example still
validates (now 26/26).

### Added
- **Domain library grown 26 → 70 domains across 9 packs** — new packs: `payments`,
  `approvals`, `documents`, `hr`, `commerce`, `data`, `integration`, `scheduling`
  (each domain anchored to real standards — PCI-DSS, eIDAS, ISO 15489, GS1,
  DAMA-DMBOK, RFC 9110/5545, COSO, SOX…). Adding a domain is a single YAML file.
- **Domain-knowledge contract + validator** — `.schemas/domain-knowledge/schema.yaml`,
  `awp validate --kb` (KB-I1..I5: closed implication graph, no orphan triggers,
  unique ids, registry ⇄ files, keyword-collision), `TEMPLATE.yaml` + `AUTHORING.md`.
- **Generated KB index** — `awp kb build-index` regenerates `index.yaml` from
  `index.head.yaml` + domain files; `--check` gates drift in CI (like `--aggregate`).
- **Classification engine v2** — `awp classify "<story>"`: deterministic synonym +
  stemming + negation matching (`passwordless`, `without email`), implication
  fixpoint, baseline union, and a zero-match beacon. The LLM proposer stays
  registry-verified and advisory (`proposed/<model>`), never counting toward minimums.
- **9 new validation rules (17 → 26)** — schema conformance VAL-050..054 (identity,
  no undeclared sections, item identity, extended ids, acyclic stage deps) and
  substance lints VAL-060..063 (no placeholders, real Given/When/Then, numeric
  plausibility, no near-duplicate requirements), in `packages/awp-cli/src/rules-ext.js`.
- **Strict-parseable blueprint schema** — `schema.yaml` now parses (compact
  `list[X]`/`enum[…]` notation quoted); `awp schema check` guards parseability and
  asserts every `required: true` field appears in `schema-summary.yaml` (no drift).
- **KB provenance + freshness** — every domain carries `standards` provenance
  (`{id, version, verified, url}`) and a `review` block (`cadence`, `last-reviewed`,
  `owner`); `awp validate --kb` warns on overdue reviews (KB-STALE).
- **Advisory review** — `awp review <blueprint-dir>`: deterministic constraint-
  coverage (domain reflection + constraint citation) plus an optional model-graded
  rubric (mock-provider friendly). Advisory only — never gates.
- **Two new golden examples** — `invoice-approval` (DMN-heavy: amount routing,
  four-eyes, SLA escalation) and `employee-onboarding` (CMMN case with discretionary
  tasks). CI validates all examples in a matrix (validate 26/26 + aggregate diff +
  convert).

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-04

Gap-remediation release closing the audit of the v2.0 `/workflow-builder` plan
(`.hermes/reports/2026-07-04-v2-gap-report.md`). All items are additive; no
existing path moved.

### Added
- **`@awp/governance`** — shared, fail-closed G1–G4 gate module imported by both
  the CLI (`awp flowable deploy`) and the Flowable MCP server, so no mutating path
  can bypass governance (Constitution R2). Missing/unapproved gate records now
  refuse deployment instead of warning.
- **Governance on MCP tools** — `deploy`, `start_process`, `complete_task` now
  gate-check via `@awp/governance`; `deploy` refuses without a resolvable
  `blueprint_id`. Runtime mutation requires an approved blueprint or an explicit
  `AWP_ALLOW_RUNTIME_MUTATION=1` escape hatch.
- **`.mcp.json`** — tracked registration so the Flowable MCP server is discoverable
  by Claude Code and other MCP clients; server split into `client.js` + `index.js`
  with `packages/flowable-mcp-server/README.md`.
- **`awp validate <blueprint-dir|blueprint.yaml>`** — the deterministic 17-rule
  engine is now a CLI command (was only reachable inside `build --execute`).
- **Test harness** — `node:test` suites for governance, CLI (aggregate, validate,
  tiers, stages, schema-summary sync), and the MCP client; a `mock` model provider
  for keyless CI end-to-end runs; wired into both CI workflows.
- **Staged golden example** — `examples/workflow-builder/login-registration/`
  now ships the 6 staged files, the aggregated `blueprint.yaml`, and converted
  `flowable/` artifacts; passes `awp validate` 17/17.
- **`mcp:` delegation blocks** on the five modeling skills; `.awp.config.example.yaml`
  config template; `zod` added to `awp-cli`.

### Fixed
- **`awp build --aggregate`** no longer crashes (`require` in an ESM module) and now
  performs a real section union with root+dependent workflow merge and id-collision
  refusal, emitting a single-document `blueprint.yaml`.
- **Staged workflow merge** — reading staged files no longer lets stage-05 clobber
  the stage-04 root workflow (affected the validator, the converter, and aggregation).
- **`awp flowable convert`** uses per-model keys (never a generic `root`) and emits
  root + dependent BPMN, DMN, and forms — 6 artifacts for the golden example (was 1).
- **VAL-013** matches mandatory domains by normalized id-or-name (previously could
  never pass); **VAL-032** is a real dangling-reference check; **VAL-040** is labeled
  informational rather than a silent pass.
- **`model.js`** retries transient (429/5xx/network) failures with bounded backoff.
- Rule count corrected to **17** across prompt, pipeline, command, maturity, and
  adapter docs (was inconsistently "16").
